    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHello! My name is a Molly. I was born and raised in Rhode Island. I currently live in North Providence. For the past three years I've been a librarian at New England Institute of Technology. If you ever need help finding resources for your classwork come to the Library for help! This is the website I am making for SE 111.</p>
